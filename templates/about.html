  <span class="sc"># Description:</span> 
  This web application serves as a comprehensive <span class="s4">drug information database</span>. 
  Users can search for drugs, add new drugs, and find suitable medications based on symptoms.
  
  <span class="sc"># Key Features:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Add drugs to the database</li>
    <li>Search drugs by name or description</li>
    <li>Match symptoms to recommended medications</li>
    <li>Interactive chat interface</li>
  </ul>
  
  <span class="sc"># app.py - Main Logic:</span>
  - The <span class="s1">app.py</span> file sets up the core Flask application.
  - It configures the database URI to use MySQL for storing drug and symptom data.
  - Routes handle interactions: 
     <span class="s3">/add_drug</span> allows users to input new drug information.
     <span class="s3">/search_drug</span> enables users to search and retrieve information.
  - It integrates AJAX for smooth, real-time search functionality and symptom-matching logic.
  
  <span class="sc"># templates:</span>
  - <span class="s1">home.html</span>: The main page has a search bar where users input symptoms or drug names. It is linked to the <span class="s3">drug recommendation system</span>.
  - <span class="s1">add_drug.html</span>: Allows users to add information for new drugs, including name, symptoms treated, side effects, etc.
  - <span class="s1">search.html</span>: Displays drug details when a user searches for specific drugs or symptoms.
  
  <span class="sc"># Database Structure:</span>
  - The MySQL database contains tables such as:
    <span class="s1">Drug</span>, <span class="s1">Symptom</span>, <span class="s1">Disease</span>, and <span class="s1">BodySystem</span>. 
    These tables store all necessary information like drug names, symptoms treated, and diagnoses.
    
  - The <span class="s1">Drug</span> model holds drug data, which is cross-referenced with <span class="s2">Symptom</span> and <span class="s2">Disease</span> tables.
  
  <span class="sc"># Logic:</span>
  - When a user enters symptoms, the system searches the <span class="s1">Symptom</span> table to match the symptoms. 
  - If no diseases match, the system looks for drugs that treat the symptoms, pulling from the <span class="s2">drug_database</span>.
  - If the symptom matches a <span class="s1">Disease</span>, information like diagnosis and treatment options are displayed instead of drugs.
  
  <span class="sc"># Frontend:</span>
  - The UI is interactive, with modern features like <span class="s4">hover effects</span>, a <span class="s4">progress bar</span>, and buttons styled for quick access.
  - The <span class="s1">chat feature</span> is embedded at the bottom of the homepage, allowing users to input symptoms and get quick responses.
  
  <span class="sc"># search_drug AJAX Call:</span>
  - When a user searches for a drug, an AJAX request fetches drug details from the database without refreshing the page.
  - It enhances user experience, making the search dynamic and faster.
  
  <span class="sc"># Conclusion:</span>
  The Drug Information Database is designed to simplify the process of finding drug and symptom-related data with an interactive, user-friendly interface.
